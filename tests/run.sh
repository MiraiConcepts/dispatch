# Everything here runs offline and sends nothing: the suite exports NTFY_DISABLE=1,
# and every case below exercises string construction rather than the wire.
#
# This file exists because the transport stopped being four private copies and became
# one shared thing on 2026-08-10. The sanitisers in particular had never had a direct
# test in any of their homes — the pipeline suites only ever grepped the source to
# check they were still being CALLED. Both guard real attacks, so they are tested on
# behaviour here. Run before commit:
